Type inference is the process of identifying variable type, if it is not mentioned while declaring variable.
Example
var b = 10;
in the able variable declarion we missed to mention its type as Int, 
but still kotlin able to identify its type at compile time and allocate memory for the same, 
this process of identofying type at compile time is called type infernce.
