//read-only variables with - val

//mutable variables with  - var

//Variables can be declared outside the main() function at the beginning of your program. Variables declared in this way are said to be declared at top level.
//for example
val x = 10;

fun main() {
    println("Hello, world!")
}

//string template exmple
val customers = 10
println("There are $customers customers")
// There are 10 customers

println("There are ${customers + 1} customers")
// There are 11 customers
